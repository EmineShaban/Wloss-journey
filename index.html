            <p class="first-p"><span class="font18">

                    Hi there, my name is Kelly Roger, I'm 36 years old, from (a popular city).</span> <b>A year ago, I
                    was OBESE, depressed, sick and dumped by my husband.</b> <span class="font18">No matter how hard I
                    tried, I couldn't lose weight.</span>
                <b>Diets, deprivation, pills and exercise just DID NOT WORK.</b><br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I have never been skinny, I had no issues
                with my weight in high school and college. After I got married and gave birth to my kid (I was 31 back
                then), things started to change.
                <br>
                I thought I would lose weight quickly after pregnancy but instead, I
                kept gaining weight, till my kid turned 3 years old. For more than 4 years my body was overburdened with
                fat!
                <br><b>At first, I didn't diet, but I did cardio every day in the gym. It seemed to me that the more I
                    exercised, the more my body became bigger!</b> <br>
                I wasn't the only one who found my obstinate, jelly-like belly
                repulsive.
                <br>
                <b>My husband began to avoid sex with me.</b> The friends who hadn't seen me in a while remarked with
                concern how much I had changed…
                <br>
                At this stage, I could see no effect from the gym, so I gave it up and
                began to eat even more to feel better. For two weeks, I ate three times as much food as I usually
                consume!!!
                <br><br>
                <span class="red font25">The result:</span> I weighed over 90 kilos. My BMI was 33.12. I was OBESE.

            </p>
            <img class="belly" src="./images/UthPreg5.1.jpg" alt="">

            <p>
                After “hitting” 90 kilos, I was determined that I had to do something else. I thought a diet would help.
                So I went through all the “top” regimes: paleo, keto, Mediterranean, mayo, whole30, etc. I followed
                celebrities’ advice on how to lose weight fast <b>but NOTHING worked.</b> I still looked like an
                elephant. I
                even stopped posting photos of myself on social media being afraid of fat-shamers.
                <br>Then, I made the
                decision to spend my money on various expensive fat-burning pills.
                <br><b>The questionable-origin pills began to
                    work, but not for my weight loss!!! Not only did they give me dry and irritated skin, but also
                    headaches
                    and insomnia. Also, I developed gastritis!!!</b><br>
                After my failure with the tablets, my real drama started. I
                fought with my husband every day. In front of the kid. <b>He started calling me hysteric pork and other
                    derogatory names.</b> As expected, the relationship with my husband was getting toxic for both of
                us. We got
                divorced.
                <br>
                <b>At that time, I was fat, ill and dumped… in total despair.</b>

                Thank God, my depression and obesity didn’t last forever because of a chat with my friend from the gym –
                Jeanne, a cute, chubby 20 yo girl that has struggled to lose weight since a teenager. She surprisingly
                announced that she wouldn't go to fitness anymore. Then, started sending me pictures of herself. <b>I
                    COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES.She had melted off!!! She had lost 10 kilos in just 4 weeks</b> , thanks to
                taking
                a product containing thousands of natural ingredients that speed up the metabolism. Impatiently, I
                typed: <b>TELL ME THE NAME OF IT!</b> She sent me a link to the official page of the product - <span
                    class="light-orange font22"><b>Uthin</b></span>.
                <br><br> I examined the compounds, a rich composition of probiotics, prebiotics, antioxidants and super
                plants such
                as Coprinus, Garcinia Cambogia and Guarana. <b>I had never tried anything like this. It turned out that
                    this thing is the ONLY SAFE weight-loss method that gives results without damaging your health.</b>
                No one
                is importing it to (country). Of course, the weight loss mafia has taken over all pharmacies with their
                inefficient and harmful products.
                <br> I continued to examine all the research, case studies and surveys in
                detail and found out that this product has several effects. It:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ✅speeds up metabolism, burning up to 14% of body fat
                </li>
                <li>
                    ✅suppresses bloating and appetite


                </li>
                <li> ✅boosts the digestive system
                </li>
                <li> ✅removes water retention in 24 hours
                </li>
                <li> ✅provides instant and deep cleaning
                </li>
                <li>✅protects against the yo-yo effect
                </li>
                <li> ✅has NO SIDE EFFECT even with prolonged use.</li>
            </ul>
