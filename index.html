                    Hi there, my name is Kelly Roger, I'm 36 years old, from (a popular city).</span> <b>A year ago, I
                    was OBESE, depressed, sick and dumped by my husband.</b> <span class="font18">No matter how hard I
                    tried, I couldn't lose weight.</span>
                <b>Diets, deprivation, pills and exercise just DID NOT WORK.</b><br><br>
             
                Although I have never been skinny, I had no issues
                with my weight in high school and college. After I got married and gave birth to my kid (I was 31 back
                then), things started to change.
          
                I thought I would lose weight quickly after pregnancy but instead, I
                kept gaining weight, till my kid turned 3 years old. For more than 4 years my body was overburdened with
                fat!
                <b>At first, I didn't diet, but I did cardio every day in the gym. It seemed to me that the more I
                    exercised, the more my body became bigger!</b> <br>
                I wasn't the only one who found my obstinate, jelly-like belly
                repulsive.
                <br>
                <b>My husband began to avoid sex with me.</b> The friends who hadn't seen me in a while remarked with
                concern how much I had changedâ€¦
                <br>
                At this stage, I could see no effect from the gym, so I gave it up and
                began to eat even more to feel better. For two weeks, I ate three times as much food as I usually
                consume!!!
                <br><br>
                <span class="red">The result:</span> I weighed over 90 kilos. My BMI was 33.12. I was OBESE.
