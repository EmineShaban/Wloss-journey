                    Hi there, my name is Kelly Roger, I'm 36 years old, from (a popular city).</span> <b>A year ago, I
                    was OBESE, depressed, sick and dumped by my husband.</b> <span class="font18">No matter how hard I
                    tried, I couldn't lose weight.</span>
                <b>Diets, deprivation, pills and exercise just DID NOT WORK.</b><br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I have never been skinny, I had no issues
                with my weight in high school and college. After I got married and gave birth to my kid (I was 31 back
                then), things started to change.
                <br>
                I thought I would lose weight quickly after pregnancy but instead, I
                kept gaining weight, till my kid turned 3 years old. For more than 4 years my body was overburdened with
                fat!
                <br><b>At first, I didn't diet, but I did cardio every day in the gym. It seemed to me that the more I
                    exercised, the more my body became bigger!</b> <br>
                I wasn't the only one who found my obstinate, jelly-like belly
                repulsive.
                <br>
                <b>My husband began to avoid sex with me.</b> The friends who hadn't seen me in a while remarked with
                concern how much I had changed…
                <br>
                At this stage, I could see no effect from the gym, so I gave it up and
                began to eat even more to feel better. For two weeks, I ate three times as much food as I usually
                consume!!!
                <br><br>
                <span class="red font25">The result:</span> I weighed over 90 kilos. My BMI was 33.12. I was OBESE.

            </p>
            <img class="belly" src="./images/UthPreg5.1.jpg" alt="">

            <p>
                After “hitting” 90 kilos, I was determined that I had to do something else. I thought a diet would help.
                So I went through all the “top” regimes: paleo, keto, Mediterranean, mayo, whole30, etc. I followed
                celebrities’ advice on how to lose weight fast <b>but NOTHING worked.</b> I still looked like an
                elephant. I
                even stopped posting photos of myself on social media being afraid of fat-shamers.
                <br>Then, I made the
                decision to spend my money on various expensive fat-burning pills.
                <br><b>The questionable-origin pills began to
                    work, but not for my weight loss!!! Not only did they give me dry and irritated skin, but also
                    headaches
                    and insomnia. Also, I developed gastritis!!!</b><br>
                After my failure with the tablets, my real drama started. I
                fought with my husband every day. In front of the kid. <b>He started calling me hysteric pork and other
                    derogatory names.</b> As expected, the relationship with my husband was getting toxic for both of
                us. We got
                divorced.
                <br>
                <b>At that time, I was fat, ill and dumped… in total despair.</b>

            <h3> Then the salvation came with Uthin - THE EASIEST WAY TO LOSE WEIGHT AND FORGET ABOUT EXERCISE, RISKY
                DIETS AND FATAL PILLS
            </h3>

            <p>
                Thank God, my depression and obesity didn’t last forever because of a chat with my friend from the gym –
                Jeanne, a cute, chubby 20 yo girl that has struggled to lose weight since a teenager. She surprisingly
                announced that she wouldn't go to fitness anymore. Then, started sending me pictures of herself. I
                COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES.She had melted off!!! She had lost 10 kilos in just 4 weeks , thanks to taking
                a product containing thousands of natural ingredients that speed up the metabolism. Impatiently, I
                typed: TELL ME THE NAME OF IT! She sent me a link to the official page of the product - Uthin. I
                examined the compounds, a rich composition of probiotics, prebiotics, antioxidants and super plants such
                as Coprinus, Garcinia Cambogia and Guarana. I had never tried anything like this. It turned out that
                this thing is the ONLY SAFE weight-loss method that gives results without damaging your health. No one
                is importing it to (country). Of course, the weight loss mafia has taken over all pharmacies with their
                inefficient and harmful products.I continued to examine all the research, case studies and surveys in
                detail and found out that this product has several effects. It:

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ✅speeds up metabolism, burning up to 14% of body fat
                </li>
                <li>
                    ✅suppresses bloating and appetite


                </li>
                <li> ✅boosts the digestive system
                </li>
                <li> ✅removes water retention in 24 hours
                </li>
                <li> ✅provides instant and deep cleaning
